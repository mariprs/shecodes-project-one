        Story time üìñ: did you know that the RPG roots grow as back as the Han
        Chinese era? There's even stories as far as from the 16th century about
        traveling teams of players who performed a form of improvisational
        theatre known as the <i>Commedia dell'arte</i>, with stock situations,
        stock characters and improvised dialogue.

        On the mid 70s, RPG evolved to a whole complete level: it became a game
        genre, with a lot of incredible titles, such as (my personal favorites)
        Skyrim, Tibia and Runescape.
